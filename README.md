# F1nalyze - Formula 1 Datathon ðŸš€

## Overview

Welcome to our submission for the F1nalyze competition hosted by IEEE MUJ Computer Society. This project aims to predict Formula 1 driver positions using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.

### Competition Details

- *Host*: IEEE MUJ Computer Society
- *Competition Link*: [F1nalyze - Formula 1 Datathon](https://kaggle.com/competitions/f1nalyze-datathon-ieeecsmuj)
- *Dates*: Start Date: 06/28/2024, End Date: 06/29/2024

### Team Members

- *Participants*: Pranali Chitre, Advait Dongre

## Files Included

- *New.ipynb*: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code used for data analysis, model development, and predictions.
- *submitted.csv*: CSV file containing the predicted finishing positions of Formula 1 drivers as per competition requirements.
- *README.md*: This file, providing an overview of the project, instructions, and considerations for reproducing the results.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- *Data Cleaning*: Handle missing values, ensure data consistency, and address outliers.
- *Feature Engineering*: Create new features from existing data to enhance predictive performance.
